# R foundations wordpress repo

This repo hosts the HTML renders of lessons, which get embedded on our Wordpress site. 

Periodically, the "copy_html_files_to_wordpress_repo.R" script is run from the staging site. 

This script copies the staging content into the wp repo, renders the lessons, then deletes non-HTML files. 

The HTML files in this repo are hosted on GitHub pages, then embedded on our Wordpress.
